# Boilerplate app
I want to have boilerplate applications ready to build upon and deploy very quickly for whatever hare-brained idea I get, so this application will do that.

## Features
This app will have a whole MaterialUI theme, an API that can be deployed on AWS easily, and more. Really, in its finished state, it should just need to be adapted to whatever use case for whatever app I want to build in the future.

## Technical details
### Frontend
React typescript bootstrapped with Create React App. I'm ripping a lot of code from [Ed Roh's React Admin Dashboard](https://github.com/ed-roh/react-admin-dashboard/) for the styling, making it work with TypeScript, and building from there.

To install and run:
```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

### Backend
Python Flask app. More later as I expand on this.
